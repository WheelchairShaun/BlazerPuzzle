Hey friends, I wanted to put together a little website that was going to show the latest episodes of the show in a nice grid and I _HAD_ started on that website using ASP.NET Razor Pages.  That felt silly to have a Blazor show and not have this website written with Blazor, so I just added the Blazor Server-Side features and converted my files to `.razor` files with appropriate syntax.

After I got my pages converted to Blazor pages and components, I tried running the application and I get a 404 when the site starts up.

Can you help fix my website?
